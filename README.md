# How to replicate
Clone the repository. Change the data in the JSON files located in `./src/components/raw` to yours. Some of the details would still need to be changed within the JavaScript files located in `./src/components/raw`, but this will be improved in the future.

# How to push to github-pages after changes
Run `npm install` if you haven't. And then run `npm run deploy`.
